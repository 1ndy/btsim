Simulate Bt-corn effect on Western Corn Rootworm

## About
Bt simulation models the effect of bacillus thuringenesis-derived 
toxins in transgenic corn against the western corn rootworm. It relies on
principles from population genetics to compute population level changes
in census number and allele frequency.

This simulation was created for ANSC 446 in SP22 at the University of Illinois.

## Usage
You must have R installed. To run the simulation:
1. Clone this repository to your local computer
2. Navigate into the cloned directory. Run R with `app.R`.
